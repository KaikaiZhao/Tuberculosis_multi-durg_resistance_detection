# Tuberculosis_multi-durg_resistance_detection
This repository contains code for tuberculosis multi-durg resistancedetection based on the analysis of chest CT scan. We train our model via python code, because the part is very similar with HEp-2 cell classification so please refer to that repository. And this repo is referred to matlab code for the classification part and mask part.
